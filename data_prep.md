First steps: 
Download data files
•	Keep original downloads separate in a “raw” data folder 
•	Extract files into a “data” folder. Organize the files in a way that makes sense for indexing later (e.g., by the content of the data they contain, by file type, etc.) 

Organize downloaded files 
•	Federal files usually don’t have enough information in the file names to denote what they contain.

Download data documentation 
•	Organize documentation files. Consider a parallel structure to the data files if that makes sense.

Read data documentation 
•	Record any useful observations about file types, layouts, data quality issues, how the data were collected, etc. 

Load data files. 
Begin exploratory data analysis (EDA)

For table data:
o	Observe and document their properties
  Range of values
  Missing values 
o	Conduct descriptive statistics 
  Means, frequencies, percentages, other distributional statistics 

For geographic data: 
•	Explore extent of maps
•	Identify point, polygon, line, and raster features 
•	Time features
